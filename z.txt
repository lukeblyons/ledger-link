Chat, from now on, our entire conversation is going to be about one project in VS Code. I have been working on it, and have an assortment of folders and files written. The code is written in html, css, js and sql. I am using node.js.

I am going to give you a list that represents my directory, which i will paste below. If it says 'Folder:' that is a folder. If it says 'File:' that is a file. Here is my directory:
Folder: ledger-link
    Folder: backend
        Folder: node_modules
        File: .env
        File: index.js
        File: package-lock.json
        File:  package.json
    Folder: dashboard
        Folder: stock-overview
            File: overview.html
            File: overview.js
        Folder: stocks-api
            File: stocks.css
            File: stocks.js
        File: dashboard.css
        File: dashboard.html
        File: dashboard.js
    Folder: landing-page
        File: landing.html
    Folder: universal
        Folder: buttons
            File: buttons.css
            File: buttons.js
        Folder: cards
            File: cards.css
        Folder: forms
            File: signup-form.css
            File: signup-form.js
        Folder:logo
            File: logo.css
        Folder: OTP
            File:  otp.css
            File: otp.html
            File: otp.js
        Folder: star-background
            File: star.css
            File: star.js
    File: .gitignore

We will go through each folder and file, and i will give you what code is inside of them. For example, Folder: dashboard contains Folder: stock-overview, Folder: stocks-api, File: dashboard.css, File: dashboard.html and File: dashboard.js. Within Folder: stock-overfiew there is File: overview.html and File: overview.js. Within Folder: stocks-api there is File: stocks.css and File: stocks.js.

once we have gone through each, that will be the code that we will refer back to. If i say 'UPDATED CODE FOR' followed by the file name, that will be the new code for that file.

If this all makes sense, tell me where you would like to start, and i will give you the code for it.
